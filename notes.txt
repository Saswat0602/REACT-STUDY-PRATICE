//JSX  ========> React.createElement ===>html(dom)


React has two types of componenet

1.functional component => nothing but a normal function of js

2.class based component ==> old model

=> Name of component start with capital letters

--//composing component use one component inside another component

------------------------


-->there can only one parent in JSX thats why we use react.fragment

porops --> passing some properties to functional component

-->React has one way binding





// Body Component for body section: It contain all restaurant cards
// We are mapping restaurantList array and passing data to RestaurantCard component as props with unique key as index


useState used to declare local variable

useState()==>//to create state variables

useState --> returns a array


Why we need state variable ?
-->bcz react cant track all variable and does not chnage normal varibale thats why we use state variable.



// Body Component for body section: It contain all restaurant cards
// We are mapping restaurantList array and passing JSON data to RestaurantCard component as props with unique key as index


//empty dependencies array  ot will call only once
  //de array[searchtext]-->once after render and every times searchtext changes.
  //de array[restaurants]-->once after render and when clicked on search .


-->1st render then api call(useeffect)

--> never write useState inside if else,for-loop
